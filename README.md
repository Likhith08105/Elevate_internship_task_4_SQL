# üöÄ Task 4: Advanced SQL Analysis - Vegetable Sales Performance

## Project Objective

This submission fulfills the advanced SQL requirement for Task 4. The objective was to demonstrate proficiency in complex database querying, including the use of **CTEs, Subqueries, and multi-field Aggregation**, using the provided vegetable sales data.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key SQL Analysis & Techniques

The analysis was performed against the `VegSales` table using the following advanced techniques:

* **CTE (Common Table Expression):** Used to calculate the total sales and contribution percentage for each supplier.
* **Subqueries:** Employed to identify specific high-performing months by filtering against the overall average sales volume.
* **Self-JOIN Simulation:** Used to accurately calculate the **Monthly Growth Rate** by joining current and previous month records.
* **Aggregation:** Used to determine total sales volume (`SUM([Sales(kg)])`) and average performance (`AVG([Sales(kg)])`).
